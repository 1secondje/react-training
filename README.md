## Project Name: "Post List with Search, Filtering, Adding New Posts, Infinite Scroll, and Fake Authentication using React Context"

### Description:
The "Post List with Search, Filtering, Adding New Posts, Infinite Scroll, and Fake Authentication using React Context" is an educational project developed using React, JSONPlaceholder API, fake authentication logic, and React Context. The project aims to provide hands-on experience with React development concepts, working with external APIs, implementing interactive features, infinite scrolling to load posts as the user scrolls, and using React Context to manage application state.

### Tools and Concepts Used:
- React
- useState
- useEffect
- useRef
- JSONPlaceholder API
- react-router-dom
- React Context

### Features:
- Display a list of posts fetched from the JSONPlaceholder API.
- Enable searching for posts based on title or content.
- Implement filtering by categories to refine the results.
- Allow users to add new posts using a form.
- Implement fake authentication logic for user login.
- Enable infinite scrolling to load more posts as the user scrolls.
- Utilize React Context for managing global application state.

This educational project provides an opportunity to explore fundamental React concepts, hooks, working with APIs, implementing search and filtering functionalities, adding new posts, simulating authentication, implementing infinite scrolling, and using React Context to manage global application state.
